This is literacy. Through reading and listening, we receive information; through writing and speaking, we transmit information.” Learning to communicate is one of the most basic of human accomplishments. When we can’t clearly express our own ideas to others, we leave ourselves open to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. If we can’t read well, we miss out on much valuable information. Being able to think, speak, read, and write clearly is absolutely vital in our society.
